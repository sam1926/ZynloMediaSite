# ZynloMediaSite

This project is a simple Express server with a React client. It was originally configured for the Replit environment but can run locally without Replit specific tooling.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The server runs on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

3. Create a production build:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. Start the production server from the build output:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

## Project Structure

- `client/` – front‑end source code.
